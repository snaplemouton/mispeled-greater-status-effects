# Mispeled’s Greater Status Effects

**Mispeled’s Greater Status Effects** adds a dedicated buff and debuff interface to the Token HUD for Pathfinder 1e, allowing players and GMs to quickly apply common spell and condition effects (such as Mage Armor, Shield, and Ward) with proper PF1 rules and stacking—without cluttering Foundry’s default status effect list.

## Features

- Add buff/debuff trays to token quickbar (Similar to status effects)
- Provides a plethora of pf1e buffs and debuffs already provided by the add-on
- Allow to add custom buff to the buff/debuff trays to make them available globally
